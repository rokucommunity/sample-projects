# Source Map example
This shows a very basic example of how to generate a source map, and then step through the source file by using those source maps.

## Setup
1. install NodeJS
2. open a terminal at the root of this project and run:
```bash
    npm install && npm run build
```
3. In VSCode, start a new BrightScript debug session, it will automatically debug this project and step through the original line locations.
